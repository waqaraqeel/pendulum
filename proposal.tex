For this project, I want to present a method using nonlinear analysis of chaotic systems to generate true random numbers.
Random number generation has extensive applications in cryptography, simulation, game theory, and so on.
Conventionally generated random numbers are at best pseudo-random given that computers are deterministic machines. A seed is
used to initialize the random number generator and care is taken to make sure that the seed is not predictable, because
given a unique seed, the generator will always produce the same sequence of random numbers.

In contrast to this, the chaotic behavior of nonlinear systems can be used to produce random numbers that are, although
deterministic, impossible to predict. I want to run a computer simulation of a double pendulum, present a nonlinear analysis
of the system, and use it's angular displacement at pseudo-random time intervals to generate a sequence of random numbers.
This sequence will then be run through statistical tests of randomness to check its quality.

\textit{Disclaimer:} For another course, I'm working on a survey of nano-techniques used for random number generation.
This is different from chaotic systems as the inherent randomness of quantum physical phenomena, such as
radioactivity and quantum tunneling, are used in that case.
